# burger

This is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The site uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Burger app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
